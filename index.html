            <h2>Sales Analysis Project</h2>
            <p>For this project I created a mock up business demand requesting sales, budget, and customer information from a companies database. They manager in this situation wanted specific information and a dynamic visualization to go with it. I created different SQL queries to grab the requested information and then imported the results into Power BI. From there I made dataset connections on the backend in Power BI. The dynamic dashboards I created are dynamic and display different information depending on the dates selected.</p>
            <p>Tools/Languages: SSMS, SQL, Power BI</p>
